    "# Probability distributions:\n",
    "- We will learn about a variety of different probability distributions, but before we do so, we need to establish the difference between discrete and continuous distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fundamental distinction among kinds of distributions is the distinction between discrete and continuous distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A discrete distribution (or variable) takes on countable values, like integers, where every outcome has a positive probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A continuous distribution takes on a continuum of values, like real numbers. It assigns probabilities to ranges of values (not any one single value)\n",

    "## 1. Discrete distributions\n",
    "- With discrete distributions, you can only get certain specific values, not all values in a range. Take, for example, a roll of a single six-sided die - there are 6 possible outcomes of the roll, and non-integer numbers between 1 and 6 are not possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniform Distribution\n",
    "    - Occurs when all possible outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "    - e.g. rolling a six-sided die\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bernoulli Distribution\n",
    "    - Represents the probability of success for a certain experiment (binary outcome).\n",
    "    - e.g. flipping a fair coin\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Binomial Distribution\n",
    "    - Represents the probability of observing a specific number of successes (Bernoulli trials) in a specific number of trials.\n",
    "    - e.g. number of defects found from a 100-random sample from the production line\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Continuous distributions\n",
    "- With a continuous distribution, you can expect to get any value within a range. Think about measuring the length of something. The reported measurement can always be more or less precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Uniform\n",
    "- A continuous distribution that takes values within a specified range a to b, when each value within the range is equally likely.\n",
    "- e.g. time take an elevator arrive at your floor. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal (Gaussian)\n",
    "- A probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.\n",
    "- e.g. individual height in a population \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential\n",
    "- Uses to model the time elapsed between events.\n",
    "- e.g. amount of time a postal clerk spends with a customer\n",
